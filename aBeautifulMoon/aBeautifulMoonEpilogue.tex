\begin{abstract}
Here we investigate what would happen if the Moon were as close as the
International Space Station.

\section{A closer Moon}

Orbits of planets (and other things) in space basically follow paths
determined by conic sections. A conic section is a ``slice'' of a
cone. Now suppose that the Moon was the same distance as the International
Space Station, as measured from the surface of the Moon to the surface
of the Earth: \youtube{oBDZtt0vWD8}

\textbf{How amazing and terrifying!}

\begin{problem}
     Write down as many mathematical questions as you can for this
     setting. After you have your questions, label them as ``Level
     1,'' ``Level 2,'' or ``Level 3'' where:
\begin{description}
\item[Level 1] Means you know the answer, or know exactly how to do
  this problem.
\item[Level 2] Means you think you know how to do the problem.
\item[Level 3] Means you have no idea how to do the problem.
\end{description}
\begin{freeResponse}
  Here are some example questions:
  \paragraph{Level 1}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item How far away is the ISS?
  \item How far away is the Moon?
  \item When measuring the distances above, what are the ``end-points?''
  \item What are landmarks that on Earth that are the same distance
    from Columbus as the ISS is from the surface of the Earth?
  \item From the video, how long was it from Moon-rise to Moon-set?
  \item What is the apparent shape of the Moon's orbit (normal and
    closer)?
  \item What is the theoritical shape of the Moon's orbit (normal and
    closer)?
  \item What is the radius of the Moon?
  \item What is the radius of the Earth?
  \item What is the mass of the Moon?
  \item What is the mass of the Earth?
  \item What formula tells you the gravitational force between two
    masses?
  \item What formula tells you the speed that an object orbits another?
  \end{enumerate}

  \paragraph{Level 2}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If you imagine the horizon as a circumfrence of a circle, what
    fraction of this circle is taken up by the Moon (both far and
    close)?
  \item What is the density of the Earth?
  \item What is the density of the Moon?
  \item How close is the current orbit of the Moon to a perfect circle?
  \item How much ``work'' (in the physical sense) would it take to
    move the Moon to the closer orbit?
  \item What is the linear speed of the Moon (in its normal orbit)?
  \item What is the radius of the shadow of the Moon on the Earth
    (normal and closer)?
  \item 
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \paragraph{Level 3}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item How well do the mathematical models actually model reality? 
  \end{enumerate}
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}
%% Inspired by this video, we wrote a number of questions. Eventually,
%% we'd like to answer:
%% \begin{enumerate}
%% \item How long would it take to travel to the closer Moon?
%% \item What would be the (upward/downward) force of gravity from the
%%   closer Moon?
%% \item What is the orbital period of the closer Moon?
%% \item During a solar eclipse with the closer Moon, what would be the
%%   area of the shadow cast upon the Earth?
%% \end{enumerate}

%% To even get started on these questions, we need to answer a number of
%% other questions.
